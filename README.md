# WPFMontyHall
Monty Hall Problem made in WPF
The gameshow has 3 doors. 2 doors have a goat behind them and 1 door has a car the contestant can win.
The game starts with all the doors closed.
The player then picks a door, then the host opens one of the remaining doors that contains a goat. (1 door picked by the player, 1 door closed, 1 door open that had a goat)
The player then has a choice to keep the original door or switch to the other door.
Once the player has decided, the winning door is revealed.
Would you keep or switch the doors?

Made this just to demonstrate if variable change is just mathematical concept or if there is a real statistical background.
Logically thinking once one of the doors is open you have a 50/50 chance of having picked the correct door.
But variable change would dictate that at first you had a 33% chance to pick the correct door. 
And once the door has been opened the chance of piking the correct door initially stays the same.
But since one door is open the 33% from the open door converges on the unpicked door.
Thus you should always switch.
With switching you should win 66% of the times.
